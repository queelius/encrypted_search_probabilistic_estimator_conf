\nomenclature{$p_t$}{The accuracy the adversary obtains at time step $t$.}
\nomenclature{$\Conf_t$}{The confidentiality of a particular sample at time step $t$.}
\nomenclature{$\VarConf_t$}{The sampling distribution of $\Conf_t$.}
\nomenclature{$n^*$}{The maximum number of trapdoors the adversary may observe without compromising the confidentiality of the system beyond a specified risk level.}
\nomenclature{$\alpha$}{The minimum level of confidentiality that the \emph{Encrypted Search} system seeks to maintain. The system is said to be \emph{compromised} if the confidentiality metric is less than $\alpha$.}
\nomenclature{$\beta$}{The maximum acceptable probability that the \emph{Encrypted Search} system has been compromised.}
\nomenclature{$[x]$}{Indicates $1$ if proposition $x$ is true and otherwise indicates $0$. This notation is known as the Iverson bracket.}
