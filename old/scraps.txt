\Cref{fig:n_vs_p} shows a plot of sample size $n$ versus accuracy $p_n$ for a simulated sequence of trapdoors. After a small number of observations of trapdoors, the adversary is able to temporarily obtain an accuracy level of $0.36$. However, this did not last and only much later did the adversary consistently score an accuracy level greater than $0.36$.
